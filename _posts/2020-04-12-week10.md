title: Week 10 -- Contribution Conituning 2
---

This week in class we did a stand-up report on our progress. Through this report, we found that we did a pretty amount of progress and contribution to p5.js-website. <br><br>

I translated all Math examples into Chinese, and made a [PR](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/pull/664). There are 3 lines of translation I and another contributor still working on because of the difficulty of translation. This is the reason that the PR is still open and not merged yet. I'll try to figure out the best way to translate it and move on to next topic in next week.

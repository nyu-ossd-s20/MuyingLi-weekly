title: Week 11 -- Open Efforts regarding COVID 19
---

Yesterday's breaking news: New York has passed a plateau of the peak of COVID-19. Since COVID-19 outbreaked in China, I have been closely followed the pandemic for several months. Same as our group; during the process of finding an appropriate project, we even explored many related open source project. There is one I want to point out, although it is technically not a open-source project, but it provides useful daily updated data set as open source: [2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). As a top medicine and public health school, JHU quickly responds to this pandemic and also sets up a [coronavirus resource center](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) to track and present first-hand data to the public.<br><br>

Continuing the challenge I left last week, this week I conquered the translation difficuly under üê£'s help and successfully finished the translation of all Math examples. They [merged the branch](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/pull/664) and the changes are on p5.js website now ;)

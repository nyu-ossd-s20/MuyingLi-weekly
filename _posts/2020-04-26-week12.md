title: Week 12 -- Ongoing Contributions 
---

This week, it seems that I became more efficient and smooth in the example translation. I translated all examples in 2 topics, Objects and Lights. They merged my [Objects](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/pull/723) translation without back and forth minor format tricks like previous, which indirectly proves that my translation is turning more precise now xixi. I just finished the translation in Lights, so the [PR](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/pull/728) is still open.
